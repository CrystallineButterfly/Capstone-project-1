          Web3 is a libary in simple terms, that allows programming language to
          interact with the blockchain, a symbiotic but adjacent, libary of
          blocks where Opcodes are completed via smart contracts! What is the
          tapestry of each page? A few weavings are; merkile partica tree,
          solidity, an EVM machine and us, the true nodes who comprise the
          network! All will be delved into, in our exciting talk, will you be
          there? We hope so! Web3 is the BEST network, we humans have ever
          created, utilised and sewed, specifially for what I call, synergetic
          symphonies. Many questions? Good, questions are an example of
          synergetic symphonies, we beings of life sing, come sing with us!
